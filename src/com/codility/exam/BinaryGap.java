/**
 * A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of
 * consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary
 * representation of N.
 * 
 * For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary
 * gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and
 * contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20
 * has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The
 * number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * int solution(int N);
 * 
 * 
 * that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary
 * gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
 * 
 * For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has
 * binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length
 * 5.
 * 
 * Assume that:
 * 
 * ?N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * 
 * ?expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N)); ?expected worst-case space
 * complexity is O(1).
